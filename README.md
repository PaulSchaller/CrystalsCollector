# Crystals Collector

##This web app is a game that internet users can play.## 

##To develop this web app, I used html, bootstrap, css, javascript, and jQuery.

##My site is published at https://paulschaller.github.io/CrystalsCollector/

This is how the web app runs:
This is the initial screen.  The player chooses from diffenent gems (diamond, sapphire, emerald, and ruby) by clicking on the 
picture of the gem.  Each gem has a hidden value.  When the player clicks on the gem, the hidden value is added to the *current score*.
The player tries to match the target score without going over.  If he is successful, the player wins the game.

This is the bottom portion of the initial screen.  It has a board to show the target number and the current score.
The board below this one is a message board that announces when the player wins or loses a game.  The total number of 
wins and losses is kept track of in the third and final board.

The next two screenshots show the results of two clicks on a gem and the accumulation of the *current score*.
